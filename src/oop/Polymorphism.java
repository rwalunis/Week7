/*
 * POLYMORPHISM: when an entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different
 * scenarios.  Example, you  have a method named "render" that exists in many different classes, buttttttt
 * performs a differnet functionality (for example, it prints out "hi" in one class, and "bye" in another.  
 * polymorphism can be achieved with the @override annotation or method overriding (like in an abstract class where inheriting 
 * classes overwrite the methods or with an interface (use jeep-sales as an example)
